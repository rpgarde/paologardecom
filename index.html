        <h3>Why is this website so ugly?</h3>
        <p>
            First I made this website to be a bit of a rebellious contrarian, going against my big tech upbringing, my ridiclously expensive coding bootcamp, and all that time I spent learning CSS, animations, React, etc. Now I realise it's a lot easier to maintain, and it gives me a bit of nostalgia. I... kind of like it?!
