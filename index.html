    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I'm currently a Product, Strategy & Ops Lead at Trace. <a href="https://our-trace.com">Trace</a> helps businesses
        and individuals take their first steps towards net zero. </p>
    <p>I've done a bit of everything over the years (Data Analyst, Strategy Manager, Chief of Staff, Head of Ops, even
        Software Engineer), but what has stayed consistent are </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            My ability to support and uplift the whole team around me - manager, peers, and direct reports - through my
            skills in analytics, stakeholder communication, & collaboration, and
        </li>
        <li>
            My love of learning new things.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>I like making coffee, riding my very old and slow bicycle, weekend bushwalks around Sydney, running my <a href="https://youtube.com/@pgblanks">YouTube</a>
        channel, and spending time with my partner and our
        two cats.
